    def handle_disruption(self, disruption_event):
        # 1. Assess impact (passengers, crew, aircraft)
        # 2. Check regulatory constraints
        # 3. Generate multiple solution options
        # 4. Calculate costs and customer experience scores
        # 5. Draft communications for all stakeholders
        # 6. Monitor execution and adjust as needed
        # 7. Generate post-incident reports
```

**Time Savings**: 4-6 hours of manual coordination per major disruption

    def ensure_compliance(self, action_plan):
        # Check against multiple regulatory frameworks
        # Validate crew duty time limits
        # Ensure passenger rights compliance
        # Generate audit trail documentation
        # Flag potential violations before execution
```

**Time Savings**: 1-2 hours of compliance checking per disruption

### **3. Cost Optimization Agent**
```python
class CostOptimizationAgent:
    def optimize_costs(self, disruption_scenario):
        # Analyze multiple cost factors
        # Consider compensation, rebooking, accommodation
        # Factor in crew overtime, aircraft utilization
        # Suggest cost-effective alternatives
        # Track actual vs. estimated costs
```

**Time Savings**: 30-60 minutes of cost analysis per disruption

### **4. Customer Experience Agent**

## ðŸš€ **Current `/query` Functionality**

The `/query` endpoint is actually implemented as `/analyze-disruption` in the agent service and provides a comprehensive flight disruption analysis system. Here's how it works:

### **Architecture Flow of /query:**
1. **Frontend** (`/ui/web/src/app/query/page.tsx`) - React form that collects:
   - Question about flight disruption
   - Flight number (e.g., "NZ123")
   - Date

2. **Gateway API** (`/services/gateway-api/main.py`) - Routes requests to agent service

3. **Agent Service** (`/services/agent-svc/main.py`) - Core LLM-powered analysis

### **LLM Integration Points:**

The system leverages LLM in several sophisticated ways:

#### 1. **Rebooking Optimization** (`optimize_rebooking_with_llm`)
```python
# Uses OpenAI GPT to optimize rebooking options based on:
# - Passenger profiles and loyalty tiers
# - Flight context and impact
# - Cost vs. customer experience trade-offs
# - Historical data patterns
```

#### 2. **Policy Grounding** (`tool_policy_grounder`)
- Uses retrieval service to find relevant policy documents
- Ensures responses are grounded in actual airline policies
- Prevents hallucination by requiring citations

#### 3. **Sentiment Analysis** (in comms service)
- Analyzes customer communication sentiment
- Adjusts response tone based on emotional state
- Provides escalation recommendations

#### 4. **Crew Analysis** (in crew service)
- LLM-powered crew situation analysis
- Risk assessment and recommendations
- Replacement crew suggestions

### **Current Capabilities:**
- **Flight Lookup**: Real-time flight status and details
- **Impact Assessment**: Passenger/crew counts, connection analysis
- **Rebooking Options**: 5+ optimized rebooking strategies with CX scores
- **Policy Citations**: Grounded responses with policy references
- **Crew Details**: Comprehensive crew information
- **Cost Analysis**: Detailed cost estimates for each option


## **Current LLM Usage Patterns:**

### **Strengths:**
1. **Hybrid Approach**: Combines LLM with rule-based fallbacks
2. **Policy Grounding**: Prevents hallucination through retrieval-augmented generation
3. **Multi-Service Integration**: LLM used across multiple specialized services
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to rule-based systems when LLM unavailable

### **Current Limitations:**
1. **Limited Context**: LLM calls are isolated, not conversational
2. **No Memory**: Each query is independent
3. **Basic Prompting**: Simple prompts without few-shot examples
4. **No Streaming**: Responses are generated all at once
5. **Limited Personalization**: Basic passenger profiling

## **Key Improvement Areas:**

### **1. LLM Architecture Issues:**
- **No conversation memory** - each query is independent
- **Limited context window utilization** - not leveraging full conversation history
- **Basic prompt engineering** - could benefit from few-shot learning
- **No streaming responses** - poor user experience for long responses

### **2. Data Integration Gaps:**
- **Limited real-time data** - relies on static CSV data
- **No weather integration** - missing crucial disruption context
- **Basic passenger profiling** - mock data instead of real customer data
- **No historical learning** - doesn't learn from past disruptions

### **3. User Experience Limitations:**
- **No follow-up questions** - can't ask clarifying questions
- **Static response format** - not adaptive to user needs
- **No multi-modal support** - text-only interface
- **Limited personalization** - generic responses

## **Comprehensive Improvement Recommendations:**

### **ï¿½ï¿½ Immediate Improvements (High Impact, Low Effort):**

#### **1. Enhanced Prompt Engineering**
```python
# Add few-shot examples and better context
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are an expert airline operations analyst. Use these examples:

Example 1:
Question: "What's the impact of delay on NZ123?"
Context: Weather delay, 150 passengers, 8 crew
Response: "NZ123 has 150 passengers (45 with connections) and 8 crew affected. 
Weather delay expected 2-3 hours. Recommend Option A: Next available flight + meal vouchers."

Example 2:
Question: "Best rebooking for VIP passengers?"
Context: 5 Gold members, 145 regular passengers
Response: "For 5 VIP passengers: Premium rebooking with lounge access. 
For others: Standard rebooking. Total cost: $1,200."
"""
```

        yield f"data: {json.dumps({'type': 'flight', 'data': flight_data})}\n\n"
        # Stream impact analysis
        yield f"data: {json.dumps({'type': 'impact', 'data': impact_data})}\n\n"
        # Stream rebooking options

- âœ… **Cost-benefit analysis** for rebooking options

### **Key Improvement Opportunities:**
1. **Conversation Memory** - Enable follow-up questions and context retention
2. **Streaming Responses** - Better user experience with real-time updates
3. **Enhanced Prompting** - Few-shot learning and better context utilization
4. **Real-time Data** - Weather, ATC, and live operational data integration
5. **Personalization** - Advanced passenger profiling and customized responses
6. **Multi-modal Support** - Voice and image input capabilities
7. **Predictive Analytics** - Proactive disruption prediction and mitigation
8. **Learning System** - Continuous improvement through feedback loops

The system has a solid foundation but could significantly benefit from these enhancements to provide a more intelligent, personalized, and responsive query experience for airline operations teams.
