3. Add `initial`, `animate`, and `transition` props
4. Use `whileInView` for scroll-triggered animations

### Modifying Flight Paths
Edit `AnimatedFlightPaths.tsx` to adjust:
- Path curves and directions
- Animation speed and timing
- Number of animated elements
- Color gradients and opacity

### Performance Tuning
- Adjust `duration` values for faster/slower animations
- Modify `delay` patterns for different sequencing
- Use `will-change` CSS for complex animations
- Implement `useCallback` for expensive animation functions
