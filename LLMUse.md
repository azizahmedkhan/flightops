## Additional LLM Scenarios That Can Save Time

### **1. Predictive Analytics & Proactive Management**
```python
# New service: predictive-svc
@app.post("/predict_disruptions")
def predict_disruptions():
    """Use LLM to analyze patterns and predict potential disruptions"""
    # Analyze historical data, weather, crew schedules
    # Generate proactive recommendations
    # Alert operations team before issues occur
```

**Time Savings**: 2-4 hours of manual analysis per day

### **2. Dynamic Rebooking Optimization**
```python
# Enhanced agent-svc functionality
def tool_advanced_rebooking_optimizer(flight_no: str, constraints: dict):
    """LLM-powered rebooking that considers complex constraints"""
    # Analyze passenger preferences, loyalty status, connection times
    # Consider aircraft capacity, crew availability, maintenance windows
    # Generate optimal rebooking matrix with cost-benefit analysis
```

**Time Savings**: 1-2 hours per major disruption

### **3. Multi-Language Communication**
```python
# Enhanced comms-svc
def generate_multilingual_comms(context: dict, target_languages: list):
    """Generate communications in multiple languages"""
    # Use LLM to translate and localize messages
    # Adapt tone and cultural context per region
    # Maintain policy compliance across languages
```

**Time Savings**: 30-60 minutes per international disruption

### **4. Crew Resource Management**
```python
# New service: crew-svc
@app.post("/crew_optimization")
def optimize_crew_assignments():
    """LLM-powered crew scheduling and legality checks"""
    # Analyze crew fatigue, qualifications, rest requirements
    # Suggest optimal crew swaps and replacements
    # Ensure regulatory compliance across jurisdictions
```

**Time Savings**: 1-3 hours per major crew disruption

### **5. Customer Sentiment Analysis**
```python
# Enhanced customer-chat-svc
def analyze_customer_sentiment(messages: list):
    """Real-time sentiment analysis of customer communications"""
    # Monitor customer satisfaction during disruptions
    # Identify escalation risks early
    # Suggest personalized response strategies
```

**Time Savings**: 15-30 minutes per customer interaction

## Agent Scenarios for Complex Workflows

### **1. End-to-End Disruption Management Agent**
```python
class DisruptionManagementAgent:
    def handle_disruption(self, disruption_event):
        # 1. Assess impact (passengers, crew, aircraft)
        # 2. Check regulatory constraints
        # 3. Generate multiple solution options
        # 4. Calculate costs and customer experience scores
        # 5. Draft communications for all stakeholders
        # 6. Monitor execution and adjust as needed
        # 7. Generate post-incident reports
```

**Time Savings**: 4-6 hours of manual coordination per major disruption

### **2. Regulatory Compliance Agent**
```python
class ComplianceAgent:
    def ensure_compliance(self, action_plan):
        # Check against multiple regulatory frameworks
        # Validate crew duty time limits
        # Ensure passenger rights compliance
        # Generate audit trail documentation
        # Flag potential violations before execution
```

**Time Savings**: 1-2 hours of compliance checking per disruption

### **3. Cost Optimization Agent**
```python
class CostOptimizationAgent:
    def optimize_costs(self, disruption_scenario):
        # Analyze multiple cost factors
        # Consider compensation, rebooking, accommodation
        # Factor in crew overtime, aircraft utilization
        # Suggest cost-effective alternatives
        # Track actual vs. estimated costs
```

**Time Savings**: 30-60 minutes of cost analysis per disruption

### **4. Customer Experience Agent**
```python
class CustomerExperienceAgent:
    def enhance_cx(self, passenger_profile, disruption_context):
        # Personalize communication based on passenger history
        # Suggest appropriate compensation levels
        # Identify VIP passengers for priority handling
        # Recommend proactive service recovery actions
```

**Time Savings**: 20-40 minutes per high-value customer
