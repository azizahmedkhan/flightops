Excellent! You already have a good foundation with existing policy documents. Let me also check if there are any other relevant files and then provide you with a revised implementation plan that leverages your existing `/data/docs` structure.


[2 tools called]

Perfect! Now I understand your existing structure. You already have policy documents in `/data/docs` that are more operational/crew-focused. For the scalable-chat design, we need to create customer-facing policy documents. Let me revise the implementation plan to work with your existing structure.

## Revised Implementation Plan - Using Existing `/data/docs` Structure

### **Phase 1: Enhance Existing Data Structure**

**Prompt 1: Add Customer-Facing Policy Documents to Existing /data/docs**
```
Add 12 new customer-facing policy documents to the existing /data/docs folder. These should complement your existing operational documents:

1. Add these files to /Users/aziz/work/flightops/data/docs/:
   - 01_checkin.md
   - 02_baggage_allowance.md  
   - 03_excess_fees.md
   - 04_dangerous_goods.md
   - 05_fare_rules.md
   - 06_rebooking_delay.md
   - 07_travel_credits.md
   - 08_special_assistance.md
   - 09_pets.md
   - 10_contact_channels.md
   - 11_loyalty_basics.md
   - 12_airport_cutoffs.md

2. Keep your existing files (13_customer_questions.md, 14_policy_customer_compensation.md, etc.) as they are - they're valuable for operational use.

3. The new files should be customer-facing summaries that complement your existing operational policies.
```

### **Phase 2: Database Schema Enhancement**

**Prompt 2: Add Knowledge Base Tables to Existing Database**
```
Add knowledge base support to your existing Postgres database:

1. Create a new migration file: `infra/migrations/add_kb_tables.sql`
2. Add these tables to your existing database schema:
   - `docs` table for document metadata
   - `doc_embeddings` table for vector embeddings
   - Proper indexes for vector similarity search

3. The tables should integrate with your existing database and use the same connection patterns as your other services.
```

### **Phase 3: Enhance Existing Retrieval Service**

**Prompt 3: Add Knowledge Base Search to Existing Retrieval Service**
```
Enhance your existing retrieval-svc to support knowledge base search alongside your current functionality:

1. Add new endpoints to services/retrieval-svc/main.py:
   - POST /kb/search - for knowledge base search
   - GET /kb/documents - list available documents
   - POST /kb/ingest - ingest documents from /data/docs

2. Add vector similarity search using pgvector
3. Implement chunking logic (300-500 tokens with 10-15% overlap)
4. Keep all existing functionality intact

5. The service should handle both your existing operational documents and the new customer-facing policies.
```


**Prompt 2: Add Knowledge Base Search to Existing Retrieval Service**
```
Enhance the existing services/retrieval-svc/main.py to support knowledge base search:

1. Add new endpoints:
   - POST /kb/search - search all documents
   - POST /kb/search/customer - search only customer-facing docs (01-12)
   - POST /kb/search/operational - search only operational docs (13-17)

2. Add document category filtering based on the numbering system
3. Keep all existing functionality intact
4. Use the existing database connection and embedding logic
```





### **Phase 4: Create Knowledge Base Ingestion Service**

**Prompt 4: Create KB Ingestion Service for /data/docs**
```
Create a new ingestion service that works with your existing /data/docs folder:

1. Create `services/kb-ingest/main.py` with:
   - Scan /data/docs folder for markdown files
   - Parse YAML frontmatter (add if missing)
   - Chunk documents (300-500 tokens, 10-15% overlap)
   - Generate embeddings using text-embedding-3-small
   - Store in database with idempotent upsert

2. Create `services/kb-ingest/utils.py` with:
   - Markdown parsing and YAML frontmatter extraction
   - Text chunking utilities
   - Embedding generation functions
   - Database operations

3. Add Dockerfile and requirements.txt
4. Update docker-compose.yml to include the service
```

### **Phase 5: Enhance Scalable Chatbot with KB Integration**

**Prompt 5: Integrate Knowledge Base with Existing Scalable Chatbot**
```
Enhance your existing scalable-chatbot-svc to integrate with the knowledge base:

1. Add new functions to services/scalable-chatbot-svc/utils.py:
   - `fetch_kb_context(query: str)` - search knowledge base
   - `route_query(message: str)` - determine if query needs KB or flight status
   - `format_kb_response(chunks, sources)` - format KB responses with citations

2. Modify the main chat processing logic to:
   - Route queries between flight status and KB search
   - Include KB context in LLM prompts
   - Add source citations to responses
   - Implement the strict system prompt you specified

3. Add new environment variables for KB service URLs
4. Update WebSocket response format to include source citations
```

### **Phase 6: System Prompt and Response Engineering**

**Prompt 6: Implement Air New Zealand System Prompt and Response Formatting**
```
Update the scalable-chatbot-svc with enterprise-ready system prompt and response formatting:

1. Create a new system prompt that:
   - Restricts responses to provided context only
   - Requires source citations for all claims
   - Provides safe fallbacks for unknown queries
   - Maintains high-level, non-committal language

2. Implement response formatting that:
   - Starts with 2-4 bullet points
   - Includes "Heads up" for exceptions
   - Adds [source] footnotes for each claim
   - Uses "I can't confirm from current info" for uncertainty

3. Add query routing logic:
   - Flight status queries → flight_status tool
   - Policy questions → kb_search
   - Unknown queries → safe fallback
```

### **Phase 7: Caching and Performance**

**Prompt 7: Implement Advanced Caching for Knowledge Base**
```
Enhance the existing caching system in scalable-chatbot-svc:

1. Add FAQ cache:
   - Cache normalized questions → final answers
   - 60-120 minute TTL
   - Use existing Redis setup

2. Add retrieval cache:
   - Cache normalized questions → top-k doc IDs
   - 10-30 minute TTL
   - Reduce duplicate KB searches

3. Optimize existing response cache:
   - Include KB context in cache keys
   - Extend TTL for KB responses
   - Add cache invalidation for KB updates
```

### **Phase 8: Testing and Demo Scripts**

**Prompt 8: Create Demo Scripts and Test Cases**
```
Create comprehensive testing and demo scripts:

1. Create `services/scalable-chatbot-svc/demo/` directory with:
   - `demo_script.py` - automated demo script
   - `test_queries.json` - predefined test queries
   - `load_test.py` - performance testing

2. Implement the 4 demo scenarios:
   - Baggage: "Can I take a 9-kg carry-on + laptop?"
   - Delay→Rebooking: "My AKL→WLG is 3h late; hotel?"
   - Live flight: "NZ278 today — will I make my 50-min connection?"
   - Unknown: "Can I ship a 25 kg lithium battery?"

3. Add curl commands for testing each scenario
```

## Key Differences from Original Plan

1. **Use existing `/data/docs` structure** instead of creating new `kb/` folder
2. **Complement existing operational docs** rather than replace them
3. **Leverage existing database and Redis setup** 
4. **Integrate with existing retrieval-svc** rather than creating separate KB service
5. **Build on existing scalable-chatbot-svc** architecture

## Quick Start Commands (Revised)

```bash
# Phase 1-2: Setup KB and ingest documents
docker compose up --build kb-ingest
curl -X POST http://localhost:8084/kb/ingest/all

# Phase 3-4: Test KB search
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/kb/search -d '{"query": "carry-on allowance", "k": 4}'

# Phase 5-6: Test enhanced chatbot
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/chat/session -d '{"customer_name": "Test User", "customer_email": "test@example.com"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/chat/message -d '{"session_id": "SESSION_ID", "message": "What is my carry-on allowance?"}'
```

This approach leverages your existing infrastructure while adding the scalable-chat functionality. Your existing operational documents remain untouched, and the new customer-facing policies complement them perfectly.

Would you like me to start with any specific phase, or would you prefer to see the detailed implementation for a particular component first?




You're absolutely right! If you already have a `policies` table for docs and an `Embedding` vector table, and you have an existing data ingestion tool, then we don't need migration files. Let me check your existing database structure and ingestion setup.


[2 tools called]

Perfect! Now I understand your existing setup. You already have:

1. **Database tables**: `docs` and `doc_embeddings` (with pgvector)
2. **Existing ingestion service**: `ingest-svc` that processes both CSV and markdown files
3. **Gateway API**: Already has policy CRUD endpoints

You're absolutely right - we don't need migration files! Let me revise the implementation plan to work with your existing infrastructure.

## Revised Implementation Plan - Using Existing Infrastructure

### **Phase 1: Enhance Existing Ingestion Service**

**Prompt 1: Enhance Existing Ingest Service for Knowledge Base**
```
Modify the existing services/ingest-svc/main.py to support the scalable-chat knowledge base:

1. Update the parse_markdown_files() function to:
   - Add document categorization based on your numbering system (01-12 = customer, 13-17 = operational)
   - Add YAML frontmatter parsing for metadata
   - Implement chunking logic (300-500 tokens with 10-15% overlap)
   - Add document category to the meta JSONB field

2. Add new endpoint POST /ingest/kb-only to ingest only the knowledge base documents (01-12)

3. Keep all existing functionality intact - just enhance the markdown processing
```



### **Phase 3: Enhance Scalable Chatbot with KB Integration**

**Prompt 3: Integrate Knowledge Base with Existing Scalable Chatbot**
```
Enhance the existing services/scalable-chatbot-svc to integrate with the knowledge base:

1. Add new functions to services/scalable-chatbot-svc/utils.py:
   - `fetch_kb_context(query: str)` - search knowledge base via retrieval-svc
   - `route_query(message: str)` - determine if query needs KB or flight status
   - `format_kb_response(chunks, sources)` - format KB responses with citations

2. Modify the main chat processing logic to:
   - Route queries between flight status and KB search
   - Include KB context in LLM prompts
   - Add source citations to responses
   - Implement the strict system prompt you specified

3. Add new environment variables for KB service URLs
4. Update WebSocket response format to include source citations
```

### **Phase 4: System Prompt and Response Engineering**

**Prompt 4: Implement Air New Zealand System Prompt and Response Formatting**
```
Update the scalable-chatbot-svc with enterprise-ready system prompt and response formatting:

1. Create a new system prompt that:
   - Restricts responses to provided context only
   - Requires source citations for all claims
   - Provides safe fallbacks for unknown queries
   - Maintains high-level, non-committal language

2. Implement response formatting that:
   - Starts with 2-4 bullet points
   - Includes "Heads up" for exceptions
   - Adds [source] footnotes for each claim
   - Uses "I can't confirm from current info" for uncertainty

3. Add query routing logic:
   - Flight status queries → flight_status tool
   - Policy questions → kb_search
   - Unknown queries → safe fallback
```

## Key Advantages of This Approach

1. **No migration files needed** - uses existing tables
2. **Leverages existing ingestion** - just enhances the markdown processing
3. **Uses existing database schema** - `docs` and `doc_embeddings` tables
4. **Builds on existing services** - enhances rather than replaces
5. **Maintains existing functionality** - all current features remain intact

## Quick Start Commands (Revised)

```bash
# Phase 1: Ingest knowledge base documents
curl -X POST http://localhost:8084/ingest/kb-only

# Phase 2: Test KB search
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/kb/search/customer -d '{"query": "carry-on allowance", "k": 4}'

# Phase 3: Test enhanced chatbot
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/chat/session -d '{"customer_name": "Test User", "customer_email": "test@example.com"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/chat/message -d '{"session_id": "SESSION_ID", "message": "What is my carry-on allowance?"}'
```

This approach is much cleaner and leverages your existing infrastructure perfectly. Would you like me to start with enhancing the existing ingestion service to support the knowledge base functionality?
